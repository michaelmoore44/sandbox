To create a new repository:
Go to your account page on github.com
click the repositories tab
click the new button (usually in the upper right hand corner)
give your repository a name, and a description if you feel it is necessary
now click create repository

To clone this new repository (get the repository on your computer):
go to your projects directory on the pc you intend to clone this new repository
create a folder to hold the previously created repository. I typically give this
	folder the same name as the repository or the project.
If you have git installed, you should be able to right click and select
	git bash here. This will open a git command terminal where you can enter
        the commands in the following steps to clone the repository.
Before cloning the repository, copy the URL for the repository to the clipboard.
	With GitHub, you can usually do this on the main page of the repository.
Now in your terminal enter the following command:
	git clone --recursive https://github.com/michaelmoore44/sandbox.git
You should now have a functioning repository.

from here you could pick up with source tree by pointing to this repository.

For now I will continue with the command line.

for the purpose of introducing git, I have added these instructions as a text
	file to the repository folder. Thi
